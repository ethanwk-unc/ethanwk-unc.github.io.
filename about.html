			This is Tabitha, a siberian tiger. These tigers originate from southeast Russia, while also coming from China and Korea. Her favorite foods are elk and boar. She is one of many siberian tigers at our zoo. This species is considered endangered due to deforestation and illegal hunting. There are only 350-400 siberian tigers left in the world. We are here to change that.

			This is Elijah the elephant. This species originates from. This is the world's largest land mammal and can communicate through trumpet calls made with their trunks or through vibrations called seismic signals in the ground which they feel through their bones. Their tusks, however, make them hunting targets due to the value of ivory and makes elephants an endangered species. There is only 415,000 left in the world. We are here to change that.

We intend to continue our efforts to prevent the extinction of endangered species, as well as learn ways to prevent new species from being added to that list. All profits and donations contribute to the maintenance of our conservatory, as well as our international research and volunteer teams. These teams include several qualified individuals who monitor animal populations and take care of them directly in the wild. This way, we don't have to lose anymore of what makes this world so special! </p>
